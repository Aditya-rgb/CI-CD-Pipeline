# CI/CD Pipeline for Nginx Deployment

## Introduction

The problem statement involves automating the deployment of a website using a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline integrates Python and Bash scripts to detect GitHub commits and deploy the website on an Nginx server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance or a local Linux server.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Bash
- AWS EC2 instance or Local Linux server
- Nginx

## Installation

1. **Set Up Nginx**:
   - Update Package Index:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     ```
   - Install Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install nginx
     ```
   - Start Nginx Service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     ```
   - Check Nginx Status:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status nginx
     ```

## Development Phase

1. **Create Sample HTML Website**:
   - A sample HTML website was created and pushed to GitHub using Git commands in Git Bash.

2. **Develop Python Script**:
   - A Python script was written to get the record of any commit that may have happened in the last 10 minutes from the time of pipeline run.
   - Key Components:
     - Utilizes GitHub API to get commit history.
     - Repository details are stored in Python variables.
     - Fetches commit history for the past 10 minutes (configurable).

3. **Create Bash Script**:
   - Develop a Bash script to clone the repository whenever a new commit is detected by the Python script.
   - Key Aspects:
     - Clone repository upon commit detection.
     - Perform `git pull` on the local server.
     - Copy files to Nginx location `/var/www/html/`.
     - Delete the cloned repository after copying.

4. **Integrate Scripts**:
   - Python script detects commits and triggers the Bash script.
   - Integration is achieved using Pythonâ€™s `subprocess` library.
   - Configure the path to the Bash script in the Python script (`bash_script_path`).

5. **Automate with Crontab**:
   - Use crontab to run the Python script at a specified interval to detect changes and update the website.
   - Example crontab entry:
     ```bash
     */10 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/deployment.py >> /path/to/your/logfile.log 2>&1
     ```

## Deployment Phase

1. **Set Up Server**:
   - Set up an AWS EC2 instance or local Linux system.
   - Place `deployment.py` and `cloning.sh` scripts on the server.

2. **Update Python Script**:
   - Change line 39 of `deployment.py` to set the correct path for the Bash script.

## Testing Phase

1. **Push Changes**:
   - Introduce a small change in the HTML code and push it to GitHub.

2. **Run Python Script**:
   - Execute `deployment.py` to detect the commit:
     ```bash
     python3 deployment.py
     ```

3. **Verify Bash Script Execution**:
   - The Bash script should clone the repository, pull the latest changes, and update the Nginx location `/var/www/html/`by copying the smaple HTML project files to this location.

4. **Check Nginx Status**:
   - Verify Nginx status:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status nginx
     ```
   - Obtain the server IP address:
     ```bash
     ifconfig
     ```

5. **Verify Website**:
   - Open the IP address in a web browser to check if the website is rendered correctly.
   - Repeat steps 2-7 to ensure updates are applied after each commit.

## Automation

1. **Setup Cron Job**:
   - Automate the workflow using cron job on the local Linux system or AWS EC2 instance.
   - Edit crontab:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add cron job entry:
     ```bash
     */10 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/deployment.py >> /path/to/your/logfile.log 2>&1
     ```

2. **Confirm Automation**:
   - Ensure the cron job is correctly set up and the process runs as expected.
   - The final outcome is automatic updates to the website with each commit made to the GitHub repository.
